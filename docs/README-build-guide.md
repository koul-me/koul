# Koul

Conditional portfolio autopilot on XOXNO lending, on Stellar testnet. Built for the Rise In x Stellar Pro Hackathon (Istanbul, 19 to 20 September 2026, Scale track).

A user creates a passkey smart wallet, brings Turkish lira in through an anchor, and writes rules such as "keep my USDC in whichever hub pays more, repay before liquidation, and pull everything back to the wallet if USD/TRY passes 50". The rules are stored in and evaluated by an on-chain router contract. An off-chain keeper only pokes the router with an agent key that the user's wallet has confined to a fixed list of contract calls. The user's funds never leave the user's own wallet or their XOXNO position.

This document covers everything built so far and how to run it. Design work for the product UI is tracked separately and is not part of this document.

**Live app: https://koul.me** (app at https://app.koul.me) · **Oracle admin: https://koul-oracle.vercel.app/oracle** · Stellar
testnet throughout. The keeper runs itself: a GitHub Actions schedule in this repo ticks every five minutes, so
autopilots armed on the live app fire without anyone's laptop being open. Passkeys are bound to the origin, so a
wallet created on `localhost` does not appear on the domain: press Create wallet there to make one.

## What exists today

Everything below runs on testnet and has transaction hashes recorded in `docs/phase0.md` and `docs/build-log.md`.

- **Smart wallet with an agent session key.** OpenZeppelin smart account (the same wasm that Sembol and smart-account-kit deploy, reproduced byte for byte). Rule 0 is the user's passkey. A second rule holds the keeper's Ed25519 key and binds it to `koul_agent_policy`, which pins the user's XOXNO account, restricts withdrawals to the wallet and USDC transfers to the pool, rate limits, and expires. Grant, use, deny and revoke are all proven on-chain.
- **Router contract (`koul_router`).** Stores ordered autopilots per user. `tick(user, id)` evaluates their conditions and executes at most one eligible action: move supply, repay debt or withdraw to the wallet. `check(user, id)` reports live condition and cooldown state. Rebalance, health guard and FX exit have executed live through the rule engine.
- **Keeper (`keeper/`).** A TypeScript loop that lists users and autopilots from the router, simulates each tick, skips when no action applies, and otherwise signs the smart account auth entry with the agent key and submits. It never holds user funds. It also keeps the mock oracle fresh.
- **Mock FX oracle (`koul_mock_fx`).** Reflector's read interface with an admin `set_price`, because no Reflector testnet feed lists TRY. Swappable for the real Reflector contract on mainnet through `set_oracle` on the router.
- **Anchor integration, both directions.** The TR Mock Anchor rejects contract addresses, so Kumbara's ownerless landing account pattern lives in `packages/core/src/anchor/` and is reused by the keeper. TRY deposit into the smart wallet and USDC withdrawal to TRY from the smart wallet both completed on testnet through the original keeper scripts.
- **Utilisation on the pool.** A second identity supplies XLM collateral and borrows USDC on hub 2, so hub rates differ and the rebalance branch fires on live data.
- **Typed SDK and parser (`packages/core/`).** Autopilot types, validation, contract codec, reads, unsigned writes, permission lists and templates. The server-only parser turns a sentence into a strict draft autopilot. The reference route is linked into `web/`; live SDK and model calls have not yet been exercised.
- **Web app (`web/`).** Next.js 16 with Sembol passkeys and the new page designs. The frontend teammate merged the new UI during this backend session; its integration with the v2 SDK still needs verification. The mock oracle admin now runs separately in `oracle-admin/`.
- **Sembol contribution.** Pull request https://github.com/keyboord01/sembol/pull/3 adds `useAgentPermission`, `GrantAgentAccess` and `AgentPermissions` to `@sembol/passkey-react`, with tests, stories and docs.

```

Two signing paths exist and only two.

- **Passkey path.** The kit builds the transaction, simulates it, hashes the resulting auth entry, and uses that hash as the WebAuthn challenge. Face ID signs. The assertion is packed into the auth entry and the account's `__check_auth` verifies the P-256 signature against the stored credential through the WebAuthn verifier contract. Used for: wallet creation, agent grant and revoke, saving rules, the first supply, borrowing, and the one transfer to a landing account on withdrawal.
- **Agent path.** Same transaction shape, but the keeper's Ed25519 key signs the auth digest with one `context_rule_id` per call in the authorization tree. `__check_auth` finds the agent rule, verifies the signature, and runs `koul_agent_policy.enforce` once per call. Used for every router tick. The user is never prompted.

## Running the stack locally

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | 1.91.1 | installed by rustup from `rust-toolchain.toml`; add target `wasm32v1-none` |
| stellar CLI | 27.0.0 | prebuilt binary expected at `~/.local/bin/stellar-27/stellar`. The Homebrew CLI on the build machine is 26.1.0 and must not be used for builds. Adjust `scripts/env.sh` if your binary is elsewhere |
| Node | 20 or newer | |
| pnpm | 8 | `keeper/` and `web/` each have their own lockfile |
| Chrome or Safari with a platform authenticator | | only for the web app |

Every shell that builds or deploys starts with:

```sh
source scripts/env.sh
```

This puts the pinned CLI first on PATH, sets `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.91.1` and `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet`.

### 1. Contracts

```sh
source scripts/env.sh
stellar contract build            # all workspace members, output in target/wasm32v1-none/release/
cargo test -p koul_router         # pure decision helpers, 3 tests
```

Do not use a bare `cargo build --target wasm32v1-none`: the soroban-sdk build script requires the stellar CLI's spec shaking and fails outside `stellar contract build`.

Upgrading the live router in place, so the address and every user's rules survive:

```sh
source scripts/env.sh
stellar contract upload --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/koul_router.wasm --source niet-testnet --network testnet
# prints the new wasm hash, then
stellar contract invoke --id CBHRTWXARGZCUDBE7IX4SZV7GDFA6PRQICZQPUSOUPN3YDCVPXQBMT2P --source niet-testnet --network testnet -- upgrade --new_wasm_hash <hash>
```

`niet-testnet` is the stellar CLI identity holding the keeper secret (created before the rename; the name is local to this machine). Create yours with `stellar keys add niet-testnet --secret-key` and paste the same secret that goes into `KEEPER_SECRET` below.

Deploying fresh contracts follows the same pattern with `stellar contract deploy` and the constructor arguments listed in each contract's `__constructor`. The router takes `(admin, controller, pool, usdc, oracle, spoke_id)`, the policy takes nothing, the oracle takes `(admin)`.

### 2. Keeper

```sh
cd keeper
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill `.env`:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `STELLAR_NETWORK`, `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`, `RPC_URL` | testnet defaults from the example |
| `ANCHOR_HOME_DOMAINS`, `ANCHOR_ASSET_CODE` | `tr-mock-anchor.fly.dev`, `USDC` |
| `KEEPER_SECRET` | a funded testnet G-secret. Pays fees, sponsors landing accounts, is the mock oracle admin and the router admin. Fund a new one with friendbot |
| `AGENT_SECRET` | the Ed25519 secret whose public key users grant. Any `stellar keys generate --as-secret` output. Its public key goes into the web app as `NEXT_PUBLIC_KOUL_AGENT_PUBLIC_KEY` |
| `ROUTER_V1` | `CBHRTWXARGZCUDBE7IX4SZV7GDFA6PRQICZQPUSOUPN3YDCVPXQBMT2P` |
| `KOUL_POLICY` | `CBDQPSGJDJUGLUIYTLAVH7C7FQE3ZN2HXOKYELNPEEUHFPV52QRI5AR2` |
| `MOCK_FX` | `CB6VNXADXR3XHCS4EKV5ZR5UJUZYQ5BZTPRHCNQE3XMKQMB4LJG6MKW2` |
| `ROUTER`, `NOOP_POLICY`, `DENY_POLICY` | phase 0 probe addresses, only needed by `scripts/phase0/*` |

The keeper and the setup scripts operate on the headless wallet described by `keeper/.phase0-state.json`. That file is gitignored because it contains the software passkey's private key. To create your own headless wallet from scratch:

```sh
pnpm phase0:t1-t3     # deploys a smart account with a software passkey, funds it, adds a noop agent rule, sends 1 XLM with the agent key
pnpm phase0:t4        # TRY -> USDC through the anchor sandbox into the wallet, then a passkey supply to XOXNO hub 1; records the XOXNO account id
pnpm setup-autopilot  # passkey: grant the agent under koul_agent_policy (pinned to the XOXNO account), remove stale rules, router.set_autopilot(wallet, 1, Lira shield)
```

`t1-t3` and `t4` write to `.phase0-state.json`. `setup-autopilot` needs `contractId`, `passkey` and `t4.accountId` in that file. The Lira shield autopilot is defined at the bottom of `scripts/setup-autopilot.ts`: five rules, health factor under 1.25 repays from the wallet, a 100 bps deposit-rate gap moves supply either way, USD per TRY under 0.0200 (USD/TRY over 50) withdraws each hub to the wallet, 900 s price staleness limit, cooldowns of 30 or 300 ledgers.

Other passkey helpers for the headless wallet:

```sh
pnpm position show                 # health factor, idle USDC, per-hub collateral, debt, rate, cash, utilisation
pnpm position supply 1 10          # also borrow, repay, withdraw <hub> <usdc>; borrow pushes the health factor down for the health-guard demo
pnpm policy-deny                   # agent-signed direct controller calls the policy must reject (7109, 7108, 7103) plus one allowed control
pnpm tx-diag <hash>                # failing diagnostic events of a testnet transaction
```

Run the keeper:

```sh
pnpm keeper:once                       # one pass over every user and autopilot the router lists: simulate tick, submit if it returns an action
pnpm keeper -- --interval 30           # loop every 30 s, also republishes the mock TRY price when older than 10 min
```

The keeper keeps no per-user state: users come from `router.list_users()`, autopilots from `list_ids(user)`, the agent rule id from the wallet's context rules. Each pass prints the simulated action, or when nothing applies the `check` view (`r1 HOLDS[+8080]` means rule 1's conditions hold with an observed rate gap of 8080 bps; `cooling` means the cooldown is running). On submission it prints the transaction hash.

Tests and typecheck:

```sh
pnpm test          # vitest, runs the ported landing account tests (9 cases)
pnpm typecheck
```

From `packages/core`, run `pnpm install`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm typecheck` to check the typed SDK.

### Frontend integration (`@koul/core`)

`packages/core` exports `Autopilot` and its strict `autopilotSchema`, `validateAutopilot`, `encodeAutopilot` and `decodeAutopilot`. Monetary values in the JSON schema are decimal strings of the contract's base units: USDC uses 7 decimals, health factor uses 18, oracle prices use 14. Do not pass JavaScript numbers for these values.

`KoulReader` takes an RPC URL, network passphrase, a funded G-account public key for simulation, and the router, oracle, controller, pool, USDC and XLM contract addresses. Its methods are `readPortfolio(address, accountId?)`, `readPositionNft(address)`, `readOracle(asset?)`, `simulateTick(user, id)`, `checkAutopilot(user, id)`, and `readFired(user, startLedger, limit?)`. `readPortfolio` discovers the account ID from the user's first stored autopilot; pass `accountId` explicitly before the first autopilot is saved. Balances and position amounts are returned as `bigint` base units, rates and utilisation as RAY values, and health factor as WAD. `readFired` requires a starting ledger so callers can paginate within the RPC event retention window. `simulateTick` is a simulation of the authenticated router call and never submits it.

`KoulWriter` adds the policy address, Ed25519 verifier and XOXNO spoke ID. Each `build*` method returns an unsigned assembled transaction for `kit.signAndSubmit`:

```ts
import { KoulReader, KoulWriter, liraShield, permissionsFor, validateAutopilot } from "@koul/core";

const ap = liraShield(accountId.toString());
const errors = validateAutopilot(ap);
if (errors.length) throw new Error(errors.join("; "));
const permissionSheet = permissionsFor(ap, { router, controller, pool, usdc });
const reader = new KoulReader({ rpcUrl, networkPassphrase, publicKey, router, oracle, controller, pool, usdc, xlm });
const writer = new KoulWriter({ rpcUrl, networkPassphrase, publicKey, router, oracle, controller, pool, usdc, xlm, policy, ed25519Verifier, spoke: 3 });
const states = await reader.checkAutopilot(wallet, 1);
const tx = await writer.buildSetAutopilot(wallet, 1, ap);
await kit.signAndSubmit(tx);
```

Other builders: `buildClearAutopilot`, `buildGrantAgent(kit, ap, agentRawPublicKey, days, name)`, `buildRevokeAgent(kit, ruleId)`, `buildSupply`, `buildWithdraw`, `buildBorrow`, and `buildTransfer`. `permissionsFor` returns the minimum router, controller and USDC call list plus transfer recipients and short descriptions for the arm sheet. Templates are `liraShield(accountId)`, `yieldOnly(accountId)`, and `healthGuard(accountId)`. The reference web route links the SDK as a local file dependency; the existing Strategy and Activity panels have not yet migrated to it.

The parser works with either provider. Put one of these in `web/.env.local` (server side only, never a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` name):

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...            # or
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                   # any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini                # a small model is enough; the output is validated anyway
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1   # optional: a gateway, or Ollama on this machine
```

A ChatGPT or Claude subscription does not work here: both need an API key, billed separately. Without a key the app
falls back to the keyword parser in `web/lib/sentence.ts` and says "matched by keywords" under the box. Check a live
key with `cd packages/core && pnpm parse-test`, which parses four sentences, one of them deliberately impossible.

The reference `POST /api/autopilot/parse` route accepts `{ text, context }` and calls the server-only `@koul/core/server` parser. `context` contains `accountId`, `hubIds`, `idleUsdc`, `healthFactorWad`, `depositRatesRay`, `fxAsset`, `fxPrice`, and `fxPriceAgeSeconds`; the frontend should populate it from live reads. The response is `{ autopilot, notes, defaulted_fields }`, with `autopilot: null` for wholly unsupported requests. The route reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the server environment and optionally `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-5`). The generated rules are validated again against contract limits and the supplied account and hub IDs. The route is a reference parser endpoint, not an authenticated write endpoint; users review and sign the resulting autopilot separately.

`readReadyToCashOut(reader, wallet, startLedger, threshold, accountId?)` checks whether a `WithdrawToWallet` rule fired and the wallet now holds at least the chosen USDC threshold. It only reports readiness; the Funds withdrawal still needs a user passkey confirmation.

The XOXNO position NFT exists on testnet: contract `CDVN5JU675MEDPVRPCYC45AHFC275UH57WEU5OTFE4WFGZBNN7HTLPSY` ("XOXNO Lending Position", symbol `XLEND`), one token per XOXNO account, token id equals the account id, owner is the smart wallet. `reader.readPositionNft(wallet)` returns `{ contract, tokenId, name, symbol, imageUrl }` or null when the wallet has no XOXNO account; the image URL is an SVG served by XOXNO's API (`https://api.xoxno.com/user/lending/image/<id>?isStatic=true&chain=STELLAR`), so the Portfolio page can render the NFT card directly. `readFired(wallet, startLedger, limit?)` walks the ledger range in windows because the RPC answers a range wider than a few thousand ledgers with an empty list, and skips router v1 events.

### Funds backend (local demo)

`packages/core` now owns the landing-account and SEP-10/12/38/6 code. The keeper scripts import it through compatibility files. `FundsService` creates deposit and withdrawal transfers and advances them when `getStatus(transferId)` is polled. It stores the SEP bearer token and pre-authorized envelopes in a private `FundsStore`; `FileFundsStore` is the local reference implementation. The public result includes the transfer ID, landing account, amount, bank instructions or quoted fiat, and status; it omits the token and pre-authorized envelopes.

Reference routes in `web/app/api/funds`:

| Route | Body or parameter | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/funds/deposit` | `{ wallet, amountTry, customer, simulateSandboxBankTransfer? }` | Bank instructions and transfer ID. The optional simulation flag is for the testnet sandbox only. |
| `POST /api/funds/withdraw` | `{ wallet, amountUsdc, iban, customer }` | Transfer ID and `unsignedTransfer` (serialized assembled USDC transfer to the landing account). The frontend deserializes it and asks the user to sign with the passkey. |
| `GET /api/funds/:id` | Transfer ID | Polls SEP-6 and landing balance, forwards funds, runs cleanup and returns current status. |

Set `KEEPER_SECRET` in the web server environment and keep `.funds-state/` private. These reference routes run in development. Production use requires `FUNDS_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=1` and a durable shared store and request authorization before exposing sponsor-funded transfer creation. The new Funds service is typechecked and the amount/public-record boundary is tested; the old keeper scripts remain the live-proven flow while the routes await a smoke test.

The wallet menu also has **Get test USDC** beside **Add test XLM**. It creates a sponsored testnet G account with a Circle USDC trustline, shows the address to paste into [Circle Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) with **Stellar Testnet** selected, then polls and forwards the faucet's 20 USDC to the passkey smart wallet. The request and CAPTCHA are completed on Circle's site. Set `KEEPER_SECRET` and keep `.faucet-state/` private; the browser stores the transfer ID so it can resume polling after reopening the menu. The faucet routes share the development-only guard with Funds. Production use requires `FUNDS_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=1`, a durable shared store, and request authorization before exposing sponsor-funded account creation.

### 3. Web app

```sh
cd web
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev                 # http://localhost:3000
```

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `KEEPER_SECRET` stay server-side for the reference parser and Funds routes. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_KOUL_*` overrides are optional and default to the live deployment. The app reads the mock oracle contract directly, without a web server route.

Every page reads testnet through `@koul/core`: pools and USD/TRY on the home page; the wallet's balances, position NFT and XOXNO position on Portfolio; the router's autopilots (`list_ids` + `get_autopilot`) on Autopilots; the router's `Fired` events on Activity. There is no sample data and no demo switch: an empty wallet shows its empty states. Arming an autopilot maps the UI rules onto the router's `Autopilot` type (`lib/model/autopilot.ts`; one UI rule can become two router rules, one per hub or direction), grants the agent key under the policy pinned to the wallet's XOXNO account, and calls `set_autopilot`. The Funds flows run through the funds routes: `POST /api/funds/deposit` returns the anchor's FAST instructions, the sandbox button calls `POST /api/funds/:id/simulate`, `POST /api/funds/withdraw` returns the unsigned USDC transfer the passkey signs, and `GET /api/funds/:id` advances the transfer on every poll.

`@koul/core` is linked into `web/` and `keeper/` with pnpm's `link:` protocol (a symlink), so edits in `packages/core` are picked up without reinstalling. Relative imports inside the package carry no `.js` suffix because Turbopack resolves them as written.

For mock FX controls, run the separate app:

```sh
cd oracle-admin
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# put the keeper G-secret in ORACLE_ADMIN_SECRET
pnpm dev                 # http://localhost:3100/oracle
```

The oracle admin's `POST /api/oracle` is disabled in production unless `ORACLE_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=1` is explicitly set. The product app's Demo controls link opens the separate app. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_ADMIN_URL` in the product app if the admin is hosted elsewhere.

The app uses Sembol's testnet preset and the public SDF relayer, so wallet creation and every passkey-signed call are fee-sponsored and no local secret is needed for user actions. Passkeys are bound to the origin, so a wallet created on `localhost:3000` is only reachable from `localhost:3000`.

The new web UI has Home, Portfolio, Funds, Autopilots and Activity pages. Its current autopilot adapter still calls the v1 router methods (`set_rules`, `get_rules`), so those screens need a frontend migration to `@koul/core` before live use. Until then use the keeper scripts above to operate the rule engine. The separate oracle controls are at `http://localhost:3100/oracle`.

The keeper loop must be running for anything to execute. The web app never signs with the agent key.

### 4. Anchor scripts

```sh
cd keeper
pnpm anchor:withdraw 2       # 2 USDC from the headless smart wallet to TRY, prints every SEP step and the FAST reference
```

Deposit for the headless wallet is inside `pnpm phase0:t4`. The anchor was intermittently down during the night of 19 to 20 September; both directions have completed since.

## Demo scenarios

The Lira shield autopilot on the headless wallet, each proven on the rule engine (hashes in `docs/build-log.md`, "Keeper v2"):

| Scenario | How to trigger | What the router does |
|---|---|---|
| Rebalance | hub 2 pays more than hub 1 by over 100 bps (the borrower on account 23 keeps it so) and hub 1 holds collateral: `pnpm position supply 1 10` | rule 1 `MoveSupply(1 -> 2, All)`: withdraw from hub 1 and supply to hub 2 in one transaction, amount capped by hub cash and the 95 percent utilisation ceiling |
| Health guard | `pnpm position borrow 1 22` with the passkey, health factor drops under 1.25 | rule 0 `RepayFromWallet(1, All)`: repays `debt + 1 grain` from idle wallet USDC, health factor back to infinity |
| FX exit | on `localhost:3100/oracle` press 50.25 lira shock, or `set_price` on the mock oracle, then a keeper pass | rules 3 and 4 `WithdrawToWallet(hub, All)`: the first hub with something liquid is withdrawn to the wallet, the next tick after the cooldown takes the other hub; an empty hub is skipped |
| Stale price | `localhost:3100/oracle` Publish stale | `FxPrice` is false for a price older than its limit; `check` shows the observed price with `holds = false` |
| Nothing to do | any pass in between | `tick -> None`, the keeper prints the `check` view and spends no fee |
| Revoke | web app Revoke, or `pnpm phase0:revoke` | the next agent tick fails at simulation with `ContextRuleNotFound`, no fee spent |

A rule whose conditions hold but whose action has nothing to move (empty hub, no debt, empty wallet, illiquid hub) is skipped and the next rule is tried, so the order of the rules is the priority.

## Findings and constraints

These shaped the code.

- **One `context_rule_id` per authorization context.** The smart account's `__check_auth` receives the root call plus every sub-invocation. A router tick is three or four contexts, so the keeper passes the rule id that many times. Getting it wrong fails with `ContextRuleIdsLengthMismatch`.
- **Auth trees bake exact arguments, positions accrue interest every ledger.** A withdraw amount read at simulation is stale by execution. Every router amount is snapped to 0.01 USDC, moves under 1 USDC are skipped, and repayments round the debt up by one grain.
- **A hub only releases its liquid cash and never past its utilisation ceiling.** XOXNO errors 112 and 127. `withdrawable()` caps by both, reading `max_utilization` from `get_sync_data`.
- **The policy rate limit counts contexts, not ticks.** A window of 40 allows roughly 10 ticks.
- **No TRY on any Reflector testnet feed** (FX, CEX or DEX). Hence the mock oracle. Interface is identical, so mainnet is one `set_oracle` call.
- **Testnet hubs had 0 percent supply rates.** Nobody borrowed USDC. The borrower identity fixes that and makes the rate gap steerable.
- **No protocol-native scheduler on Soroban.** SoroCron exists but its executor contract is the invoker, so it cannot carry a user's smart account authorization. The keeper is required.
- **The anchor rejects contract addresses** and its watcher ignores Soroban transfers. The landing account is an ownerless classic G-account with pre-authorized forward and cleanup transactions, sponsored by the keeper, alive for under a minute per transfer.
- **The agent cannot pay a landing account.** The policy allows USDC transfers to the pool only and landing accounts are created per transfer, so cashing out to TRY still takes one passkey confirmation for the transfer step.
- **SAC contracts have no wasm**, so calls to the USDC token are built with `contract.AssembledTransaction.build` rather than `contract.Client.from`.
- **The kit hides simulation diagnostics.** The keeper wraps `kit.rpc.simulateTransaction` to surface `Error(Contract, #N)`.
- **XOXNO's health factor read touches a Reflector round key** that changes every 5 minutes. A tick simulated just before the round boundary can fail at execution with "outside of the footprint"; the next pass succeeds. The keeper treats it as any other failed submission.

## Phase 0 gates

The project brief defined go/no-go gates. All passed. Details and hashes are in `docs/phase0.md`.

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| T0 toolchain and provenance | smart account wasm reproduced byte for byte from OpenZeppelin `1e513890` |
| T1 smart account | headless wallet deployed |
| T2 custom policy install | noop policy installed under a Default rule |
| T3 agent-only call, positive and deny | agent key signs alone, deny policy rejects at simulation |
| T4 anchor USDC into the wallet and XOXNO supply | account 12 |
| T5 agent-signed cross-hub withdraw and supply | two transactions |
| T6 the same through the router, atomic | one transaction, four contexts |
| T7 real policy: allowlist, recipient, expiry, rate limit | all four negatives rejected at simulation |
| Revoke | one passkey call, agent cut off immediately |
| T8 oracle and rates | two findings, both handled |
| T9 anchor with a contract wallet | solved with the landing account port |

T3 and T5 green meant custody stays in the user's smart account with a session key, no vault.

## Open items

- Router becomes a rule engine (ordered rules per autopilot, conditions with all or any, one action, cooldown), keyed by user and autopilot id, with keeper changes. Decided in principle, not started.
- Designed web app on shadcn, replacing the prototype in `web/`. Design is in review.
- Oracle admin moves to its own app.
- Sentence to rules route backed by Claude.
- Cash out to TRY as an autopilot action needs the landing account decision above.
- The Sembol pull request is open and unreleased; the web app inlines the same logic until then.
