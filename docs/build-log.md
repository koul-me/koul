# Build log (after phase 0)

Continues `docs/phase0.md`. Same testnet, same headless wallet `CBHMG4IG...` (XOXNO account 12).

## Live contracts

| Contract | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `koul_router` (real) | `CBHRTWXARGZCUDBE7IX4SZV7GDFA6PRQICZQPUSOUPN3YDCVPXQBMT2P` | admin = keeper G-account, upgradeable in place (`upgrade`, `set_oracle`); wasm `b1d72bd1...` (v1, fixed branches) then `2c8448d6...` (rule engine, 2026-09-20) |
| `koul_agent_policy` | `CCEYSMIWTRJL7GE6G4MVKEC4NONUCTYVMZKMQH7D3PTQ7DPBLU5V3X4O` | unchanged since T7 |
| `koul_mock_fx` | `CB6VNXADXR3XHCS4EKV5ZR5UJUZYQ5BZTPRHCNQE3XMKQMB4LJG6MKW2` | Reflector read interface + `set_price`, admin = keeper; TRY quoted as USD per TRY, 14 decimals |
| router probe (phase 0) | `CA53BZYX...` | retired |

Wallet rules: `0:multisig` (passkey), `6:koul-agent-bhrtwx` (agent Ed25519 + policy allowlisting the real router's
`tick`, controller `withdraw`/`supply`/`repay`, USDC `transfer` -> pool only; 40 enforce calls per 2000 ledgers).

## Router (`contracts/koul_router`)

`set_rules(user, Rules)` passkey-signed; `tick(user) -> Action` agent-signed. Priority: health guard > rebalance >
FX exit > `None`. Reads: controller `get_health_factor` / `get_collateral_amount` / `get_borrow_amount`, pool
`get_deposit_rate` / `get_sync_data` / `get_supplied_amount` / `get_borrowed_amount`, oracle `lastprice` (Reflector
interface, staleness checked against `max_price_age_secs`). Emits `Fired { user, account_id, branch, amount,
from_hub, to_hub, observed, observed_2 }`. Pure decision helpers are unit-tested (`cargo test -p koul_router`).

Two protocol constraints learned the hard way, both now handled inside the router:

1. **Amounts must be identical at simulation and execution.** The smart account's auth tree bakes the exact args
   of every sub-invocation. Positions accrue interest every ledger, so `withdraw(get_collateral_amount())` was
   rejected by the controller with `Unauthorized function call` at execution (tx `cac31068...`). Every amount is
   now snapped to 0.01 USDC (`floor_grain` / `ceil_grain`), moves under 1 USDC are ignored (`MIN_MOVE`), and repay
   rounds the debt up (the controller refunds excess).
2. **A hub only releases its liquid cash, and never past the utilisation ceiling.** XOXNO pool errors
   `InsufficientLiquidity` (112: `cash >= amount`) and `UtilizationAboveMax` (127: `borrowed / (supplied - w) <=
   max_utilization`). `withdrawable()` caps every withdrawal by both, minus one grain of margin, reading
   `max_utilization` from `get_sync_data`. FX exit pulls what is liquid, stays armed while >= 1 USDC remains.

## Keeper (`keeper/src/keeper.ts`)

Every N seconds, per user: build `router.tick(user)` with the keeper G-account as source (this simulates), skip on
simulation error or `Action::None` (no fee), otherwise sign the smart-account auth entry with the agent key,
`context_rule_ids = [rule] * contexts`, submit, log the on-chain result. `pnpm tsx src/keeper.ts --once` for one
pass, `--interval 30` for the loop. Setup for a user: `pnpm tsx scripts/setup-rules.ts` (passkey: grant rule, remove
stale koul-agent rules, `set_rules`).

Cron: there is no protocol-native scheduler on Soroban. SoroCron (testnet registry
`CDOAY46V2REWSINTZINUKTYELO5FYVEOCFWEKVMGH4BUJPSTRZTRGQ5W`) runs jobs through its own executor contract as the
invoker, so it cannot carry a user's smart-account authorization; Koul's keeper is required. SoroCron could poke a
permissionless entry point later (roadmap).

## Live runs (2026-09-20)

| Run | Router decision | Tx | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| rebalance, gap hub2 5.56 % vs hub1 1.35 % > 100 bps | `Rebalance(1 -> 2, 31.99 USDC)` | `e3b7a9bcac4ddf61738086ffdff1aba521ed1aa3eb79ae594dc47c2aeb59c0da` | hub1 0.0003, hub2 49.99 |
| next tick | `None` | none | idempotent |
| mock price set to 0.0199 USD/TRY (level 0.0200, `fx_above=false`) | `FxExit(26.82 USDC)`: hub 2 had 12 USDC lent out, cap = cash and 95 % utilisation | `dbd7bbc882aa5bff4af270c6105573760ee110307823a4b6a6c8cd559e0d8fed` | wallet 27.82 USDC idle, hub2 23.17 left, rule still armed |
| next tick | `None` (no liquid cash to pull) | none | |

| passkey borrow 16 USDC from hub 1 (`b7771a7e...`), health factor 1.1585 < 1.25 | `Repay(1, 16.01 USDC)` from idle wallet USDC | `16911f1d8511420e...` (second tick; the first re-simulation caught the debt drifting past a rounding boundary, fixed by adding one grain of margin, router wasm `f14369a5...`) | debt 0, health factor back to infinity, wallet 27.82 USDC |

Rule set on-chain: account 12, hubs 1/2, 100 bps threshold, min health factor 1.25 (WAD), FX exit when USD per TRY
<= 0.0200 (USD/TRY >= 50), max price age 900 s. Mock price reset to 0.020498 afterwards.

Failed attempts, kept for the record: `cac31068...` (arg drift, above), `53c38522...` (keeper submitted a tick
whose simulation had failed; the keeper now refuses to submit in that case).

## Anchor withdrawal from the contract wallet: PASS (2026-09-20, `keeper/scripts/anchor-withdraw.ts`)

Kumbara's reverse landing account, with the keeper G-account as sponsor and a local fee-bump relay
(`keeper/src/anchor/local-relay.ts`) instead of the hosted relay. 2 USDC -> 97.08 TRY.

| Step | Tx / id |
|---|---|
| landing account (ownerless after lock) | `GDASMEJZBZZDVWMZYEKROKC53ILUZKXT2MIELG2EOAZ5XKZTFIMAGSW2`, create `62fa8f2f...`, lock `9045d76f...` |
| SEP-10 as the landing account (1 challenge signed), SEP-12, SEP-38 sell quote | `qt_ym1tw3u5ou7c2j8d3bqx`: 2.0000000 USDC -> 97.08 TRY |
| SEP-6 withdraw-exchange | `sep_s2igb4z11xcmisqugudx`, treasury `GCLCZEQZ...`, memo id `166956551683` |
| smart account -> landing SAC transfer (passkey) | `8d473020af5230197ec9140ce62d40f4bdb7a04aa0ccef4675d6d45fdc4014cb` |
| pre-authorized classic payment to the treasury with the memo, fee-bumped by the keeper | `2a5be8866b8359602072fcc3f1dfadf9073ae996bff318d8075b230ba64a98c7` |
| anchor matched and paid | `completed`, `FAST-OR36GGTULN`, "TRY paid to TR33...1326 via FAST (simulated)" in ~6 s |
| cleanup (trustline off, merge to sponsor) | `e070a0939a5ce1c0cd90968a597258e58b2a884a8d41ca9158adc05858a67def` |

For the FX-exit product flow the keeper runs exactly this after the router's `fx_exit` event, with the withdrawn
amount, and the SAC transfer to the landing account is the one step that still needs the passkey (the policy only
allows agent transfers to the pool). Option for later: let the router's FX branch transfer to a landing account the
keeper names, allowlisted per tick; not done.

## Still open

- Sembol PR (grant / revoke screens), real Face ID wallet, frontend and activity feed from `Fired` events.
- Demo script: rebalance needs a fresh rate gap (borrow/repay from account 23); FX exit needs `set_price` on the
  mock oracle; health guard needs a passkey borrow (`scripts/demo-health.ts`).

## Frontend, oracle admin, Sembol PR (2026-09-20)

**`web/`** (Next.js 16, `@sembol/passkey-react` 0.4.0 with the testnet preset and its public SDF relayer, so wallet
creation and every passkey-signed call are fee-sponsored): `/` = create/connect passkey wallet, XLM + USDC balances,
**Agent access** (grant the keeper key under `koul_agent_policy` with a 1/7/30-day expiry, list, revoke),
**Strategy** (router `set_rules` with a passkey), **Activity** (router `Fired` events for this wallet, decoded into
sentences). `/oracle` = mock FX admin: current USD/TRY, age, `Set price`, presets (48.79 calm, 50.25 shock,
publish stale). The price write goes through `POST /api/oracle`, the only server-side secret (`ORACLE_ADMIN_SECRET`
in `web/.env.local`). Run: `cd web && pnpm dev -p 3210` (port 3000 is taken by another project on this machine).
Verified in Chrome: pages render without console errors; the oracle panel set the price on-chain from the browser.

**Keeper feed:** the keeper republishes the mock TRY price whenever it is older than 10 min, so the router's 900 s
staleness guard never trips outside a deliberate "publish stale" demo.

**Sembol PR:** https://github.com/keyboord01/sembol/pull/3, from fork `atahanyild/sembol`, branch
`feat/agent-permissions`. Adds `useAgentPermission()`, `<GrantAgentAccess />`, `<AgentPermissions />`,
`agentKeyBytes`, `findAgentRules`; 7 tests (suite 120/120), Storybook stories, README, CHANGELOG. Contract-free.
The Koul web app inlines the same logic against the published 0.4.0 until the PR is released.

**Not yet exercised: a real Face ID passkey in a browser.** Everything else in the chain (this wallet wasm, the
WebAuthn verifier, `rules.add` with a custom policy, agent signing, revoke) ran on-chain with a software passkey.
The remaining check is a human pressing "Create wallet" at `http://localhost:3210`.

## Router v2: rule engine (2026-09-20)

`contracts/koul_router` rewritten as a data-driven rule engine (PLAN.md section A). Same address, upgraded in place.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `stellar contract upload` | wasm `2c8448d6189cb23ce096ef30291bb6223bae74a7b87d20648d6bbd6fabd5a661`, tx `ebeef0dfa5631734646bcd8cfbef0db12a65d4cd581fe3dce3d6f1a40547fe19` |
| `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` by the keeper admin | tx `2afcf35e5245fda5dc4a1ae9d70da04a65352ad3240b3ff22c65c96fa5f71479` |
| after upgrade | `list_users() = []`, `get_config` unchanged, `list_ids(CBHMG4IG...) = []`; the v1 `Rules(user)` entry is orphaned and ignored |

Interface: `set_autopilot(user, id, Autopilot)` / `clear_autopilot(user, id)` (user auth), `get_autopilot`,
`list_ids(user)`, `list_users()`, `check(user, id) -> Vec<RuleState>` (read-only, per rule: ready, holds, per
condition holds + observed value, last fired ledger), `tick(user, id) -> Option<Executed>` (user auth via the agent
rule). Types: `Cmp {Below, AtOrAbove}`, `Amount {All, Percent(bps), Fixed(i128)}`, `Condition {HealthFactor(cmp,
wad), SupplyRateGap(hub_over, hub_under, min_bps), FxPrice(symbol, cmp, level, max_age_secs), IdleBalance(cmp,
amount)}`, `Action {MoveSupply(from, to, amt), RepayFromWallet(hub, amt), RepayWithCollateral(withdraw_hub,
repay_hub, amt), WithdrawToWallet(hub, amt)}`, `Rule {conditions, match_all, action, cooldown_ledgers}`,
`Autopilot {account_id, rules}`. Limits enforced on-chain: 1..=8 rules, 1..=3 conditions, cooldown > 0, hubs differ
for moves and rate gaps, percent 1..=10000 bps, fixed >= 1 USDC, positive levels. Events: `AutopilotSet`,
`AutopilotCleared`, `Fired {user, autopilot_id, rule_index, kind, amount, from_hub, to_hub, observed[]}`.

Semantics: rules are walked top to bottom; a rule still in cooldown is skipped; a rule whose conditions hold but
whose action resolves to nothing (no collateral, no debt, empty wallet, illiquid hub) is skipped and the next rule is
tried; the first rule that executes ends the tick. Stale or missing oracle prices make `FxPrice` false instead of
panicking. Tests: 8 (helpers, validation, registries, and three scenario tests against mock controller / pool /
oracle with a real Stellar asset contract).

The keeper and `setup-rules.ts` still speak the v1 interface at this point; section C updates them.

## Policy v2: pinned account and withdraw recipient (2026-09-20)

`contracts/koul_agent_policy` gained `account_id` in `KoulAgentParams` and three checks in `enforce`: controller
`withdraw` / `supply` / `repay` must name the pinned account (`7108 AccountNotAllowed`), and `withdraw`'s `to` must be
`None` or the smart account (`7109 WithdrawRecipientNotAllowed`). `TransferArity` became `Arity` (7105). New
deployment, the old policy address is retired.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| deploy | `CBDQPSGJDJUGLUIYTLAVH7C7FQE3ZN2HXOKYELNPEEUHFPV52QRI5AR2`, wasm `ad6bddd7...`, tx `5bedc8b6ccb9379f6851e111c845db8a1604931ed40d2389e15eb72b6318938e` |
| `rules.add` koul-agent-bhrtwx (agent key + policy v2, account 12, 1 day) on `CBHMG4IG...` | rule id 7, tx `1df68d4c29d32856e497113cdb7ac72305d7fb9ea78c253b95ee9624434f0c64` |
| `rules.remove` 6 niet-agent-bhrtwx (policy v1) | tx `69b61e662ffa6d9f15f54f30459b310f0376991222bde5150616bfdc2b92af89` |
| agent-signed `controller.withdraw(..., to = GBRXD5JO...)` | rejected in simulation with `#7109` |
| agent-signed `controller.repay(wallet, 23, ...)` | rejected in simulation with `#7108` |
| agent-signed `controller.borrow(...)` | rejected in simulation with `#7103` (not allowlisted) |
| agent-signed `controller.withdraw(..., to = wallet)` (control) | submitted `b7ec85ab58ff00f80e2c80aba098c7f8f26d4a2d9e2f518d224f8fbff09b2c5e`, `4389e4cc3007534e1a63b73cd4693f378ae36fe4fda9da5754a2a30e8c63b0ba` |

Wallet rules now: `0:multisig` (passkey), `7:koul-agent-bhrtwx`. `pnpm policy-deny` reruns the four checks. XOXNO
itself refuses `supply` into an account the caller does not own (`#44`), so the account pin only adds a second
line of defence there; for `repay` it is the only one.

Note on testing the policy: a call XOXNO rejects in simulation never reaches `__check_auth`, and the kit then submits a
transaction without auth entries which the network answers with `txMALFORMED`. `policy-deny` checks the simulation
first and reports "policy not reached" instead.

## Keeper v2 and the three scenarios on the rule engine (2026-09-20)

`keeper/src/keeper.ts` is stateless: `router.list_users()` x `router.list_ids(user)`, one `tick(user, id)` each,
agent rule id read from the wallet's context rules, `check(user, id)` logged when a tick is `None` (`--quiet` to skip).
`scripts/setup-autopilot.ts` replaces `setup-rules.ts`; `scripts/position.ts` (passkey supply / borrow / repay /
withdraw / show) replaces `demo-health.ts`; `scripts/tx-diag.ts <hash>` prints a failed transaction's diagnostics.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `set_autopilot(CBHMG4IG..., 1, Lira shield)` (passkey): 5 rules, health guard 1.25 / rate gap 100 bps both ways / FX exit both hubs at USD per TRY < 0.0200 | tx `dd4ca8a0320c2c3ec272a6722b421481c33b5b25914a620a139b8f94b93c69b0` |

| **FX exit**: rule 3 (hub 1) skipped as empty, `withdraw rule 4 amount 10.00 USDC hub 2` (capped by hub 2's 95 % utilisation ceiling, 23.18 stays) | tx `2f37d8b44b2b902bed140d02fc593c692cdcaa50038a3a0c4d0a39a20bc09cd9` |

Position after the run: hub 1 0 USDC, hub 2 23.18 USDC (hub 2 is at its utilisation ceiling, borrower account 23
owes 12 USDC there), wallet 23.82 USDC idle, no debt. The `web/` prototype still speaks the v1 router interface and
the v1 policy params; it is rewired to `@koul/core` in section D.

## SDK live smoke test and position NFT (2026-09-20)

`packages/core` `pnpm smoke` runs `KoulReader` and `KoulWriter` against testnet on the headless wallet (read-only,
writes simulated, nothing signed). Results: `readPortfolio` account 12, idle 25.82 USDC, hubs with collateral, debt,
rates, utilisation; `readOracle` TRY 0.02049600 (14 decimals), age reported; `checkAutopilot` five rule states with
observed values; `simulateTick` null (nothing to do); `validateAutopilot(liraShield)` no errors; codec round trip
equal; `buildSetAutopilot` simulates with one auth entry for the wallet; `buildWithdraw` from hub 2 simulates to XOXNO
`#127` because hub 2 sits at its utilisation ceiling (expected, not an SDK fault).

Two fixes from the run: `readFired` returned nothing for a 17280-ledger range because the RPC answers wide ranges
with an empty list (a 5000-ledger range returned the events); it now walks 5000-ledger windows with cursor paging and
skips router v1 `Fired { branch }` events. Verified: three events, `move_supply` / `repay_wallet` / `withdraw` with
the hashes above.

Position NFT (PLAN H1): XOXNO's `get_health_factor` calls `owner_of(12)` on
`CDVN5JU675MEDPVRPCYC45AHFC275UH57WEU5OTFE4WFGZBNN7HTLPSY` = "XOXNO Lending Position" (`XLEND`), total supply 14.
`owner_of(12)` = the headless wallet, `balance(wallet)` = 1, `get_owner_token_id(wallet, 0)` = 12, `token_uri(12)` =
`https://api.xoxno.com/user/lending/image/12?isStatic=true&chain=STELLAR` (HTTP 200, `image/svg+xml`, 86 KB).
`KoulReader.readPositionNft(address)` added.

## FundsService deposit smoke, stopped at anchor (2026-09-20)

The new `FundsService.createDeposit` was exercised with 100 simulated TRY for the headless wallet. It created ownerless
landing account `GA2JQQPGSDANJELXGEGGIOCEENQZXTA57SQ6MWBQAM7YW67DQZESJVUY` and locked its pre-authorized
forward/cleanup envelopes. The SEP-38 quote expected 2.0396090 USDC. The sandbox bank-transfer hook accepted the
payment (a second call returned HTTP 409, "This deposit already received its bank transfer"), but SEP-6 remained
`pending_anchor` with "TRY received; paying USDC on Stellar." Polling was stopped at the user's request to ignore the
broken anchor. No forward or cleanup was submitted, and no wallet funds were moved by this run.

| Step | Testnet transaction |
|---|---|
| landing account created | `4f00f3922edbd7cd3cbc2b1aadd37a80e9d5704e2fcfe9eed06ce1f44750de1e` |
| pre-authorized envelopes locked | `e52080b23bfd58fc4d4bc2411e660e2a7c214d5c39fcecef0711901f79d91fb4` |

Transfer ID `7eb83fc2-c8a3-4922-9357-87e867c2b648` has a private local record at
`/private/tmp/koul-funds-smoke/7eb83fc2-c8a3-4922-9357-87e867c2b648.json`. It contains the SEP bearer token and
pre-authorized envelopes, so do not publish the record. Resume or abort only after the anchor is healthy.

## Router v3: an autopilot can open a position (2026-09-20)

`Action::SupplyFromWallet(hub, amount)` added: it takes the wallet's idle USDC, resolves the amount against that
balance and calls `controller.supply` into `hub`. Without it a rule could only move a position that already existed,
so a demo that starts from an empty wallet had nothing to show. The policy already allowlists `controller.supply`
and USDC transfers to the pool, so no policy change was needed.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `stellar contract upload` | wasm `2b8822123c73a09f0d7ab962faf90dd6bbcf04999792010890c4e5c29f10f96d` |

`@koul/core` carries the variant through the schema, codec and permissions; the web model exposes it as "put the idle
USDC in my wallet into a pool" with a pool picker, and a new "Put it to work" template starts from it. Unit tests: 9.

## Event reads fixed (2026-09-20)

`readFired` asked for seven days of history while the testnet RPC keeps about `120000` ledgers, so the node rejected
the call with a plain `{ code: -32600, message: "startLedger must be within the ledger range: ..." }`. That object
reached the UI as "[object Object]" on Activity and on the Funds history. The reader now clamps the window to
`getHealth().oldestLedger` and wraps RPC rejections in an `Error` carrying the node's own sentence (`rpcMessage`),
which the web store also uses for anything else that throws a bare object.

## The bug behind every failed signature (2026-09-20)

Arming failed with Sembol's generic "Something went wrong": the key grant, and the supply that opens a position,
both died before reaching the chain. The cause was two copies of the same library. `packages/core` had its own
install of `@stellar/stellar-sdk` and `smart-account-kit`, so an `xdr.ScVal` built inside `@koul/core` was not an
instance of the `xdr.ScVal` class the wallet kit checks against. The kit then tried to convert it as if it were a
plain object and threw `TypeError: cannot interpret ChildUnion value as ScVal`. Reproduced headlessly with
`KoulWriter.buildGrantAgent` against the software-passkey wallet.

Fixed with a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` covering `web`, `keeper`, `packages/*` and `oracle-admin`. All four now resolve
`@stellar/stellar-sdk@16.0.1` and `smart-account-kit@0.6.2` to one physical copy in the store, and `@koul/core` is a
`workspace:*` dependency instead of `link:`. After the change the same call went through: `rules.add` tx
`408c9dbc329b3f2ecf3499e226ee3b487b9fa800e800040515411ce14b9ac9c7`, probe rule removed again in
`3f5189ce313e083f57b6d1c8381679367f437d8cd621ab84d5f90bacb380a3cd`, and `buildSupply` with account id 0 simulates.

Also: failures now say what the chain said. `toastError` prefers the contract error over Sembol's generic sentence
and logs the raw error, and `describeFailure` names the policy codes (7103, 7104, 7106, 7108, 7109), the router
codes (7200, 7201, 7206) and XOXNO's liquidity codes (112, 127).

## First end-to-end autopilot on a browser passkey wallet (2026-09-20)

Wallet `CCDWPO4QAXLRYZBJA2LBHU44MS34JRRNZQXFS3QQFIOBAGP6MBDFBDPX`, created in Chrome with a real passkey, armed from
the app: position NFT token 25, autopilot 1 = `IdleBalance >= 5 USDC -> SupplyFromWallet(hub 1, All)`, cooldown 12
ledgers. The keeper picked it up on its first pass and the rule fired: `supply rule 0 amount 20.00 USDC hub 1`,
auth `tick > supply > transfer`, tx `d03ac8676140465b2dd0c06b90c5ca6f10b12d9b744f2adcfc672e035d103131`. Activity
shows it as "Put 20.00 USDC to work in USDC · Main hub".

Two web fixes came out of the same session. WebAuthn allows one ceremony at a time, and a second prompt aborts the
first with "the operation either timed out or was not allowed" and "authentication ceremony was sent an abort
signal"; `usePasskeyAction` now holds a module-wide lock, refuses a second prompt while one is open, and treats a
dismissed or timed-out prompt as a cancellation rather than a failure. Re-arming after a failed key grant also
compares the stored autopilot with what it would write and skips the rules signature when they match, so recovering
from a half-finished arm costs one prompt instead of two.

## The parser takes any provider (2026-09-20)

`parseAutopilot` now speaks to Anthropic or to any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint, chosen by whichever
key is present and overridable with `KOUL_PARSER`. The tool schema is generated from the zod schema either way, so
both providers get the same strict shape, and the result is validated against the contract's limits before it can
reach a signature. This exists because a ChatGPT or Claude subscription cannot be used programmatically: both need
an API key. A small model such as `gpt-4o-mini` is enough, and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` points at a gateway or a local
Ollama. The prompt also learned the two new rule types, `SupplyRate` and `SupplyFromWallet`.
`cd packages/core && pnpm parse-test` runs four sentences against whatever is configured.

## The parser is live (2026-09-20)

An Anthropic key went into `web/.env.local` and `pnpm parse-test` ran four sentences end to end against
`claude-sonnet-5`. Three findings, all fixed:

- `strict: true` on the tool made the API reject the request: Anthropic's strict schema subset does not allow
  `maxItems`, which our rule and condition counts use. The tool is sent without a strict flag; zod plus
  `validateAutopilot` still gate everything before a signature, so nothing invalid can get through.
- The model sometimes wrapped the result in a second copy of the top-level key. `unwrap` takes the inner object.
- It inverted the lira threshold, returning `FxPrice(TRY, AtOrAbove, 5e15)` for "if the lira passes 50", which can
  never be true. The oracle quotes USD per TRY, the inverse of what people say, so the prompt now spells out
  `round(1e14 / rate)` with the direction for a weakening and a strengthening lira, and asks for a sanity check
  against the context price.

After the fixes: "whenever I have at least 10 USDC sitting in my wallet, put it into the pool that pays more" became
`IdleBalance >= 10 USDC -> SupplyFromWallet(hub 2)` with a note explaining that hub 2 pays more; the three-clause
Lira shield sentence became the health guard, the rate-gap move and `FxPrice(TRY, Below, 2000000000000)`; "if the
secondary pool pays more than 60% a year" became `SupplyRate(hub 2, AtOrAbove, 4700 bps)`, the correct
`ln(1.6)` conversion from compounded APY to the pool's simple rate; and "buy me gold when bitcoin dips" returned no
autopilot with a note naming the five actions that exist. Verified again through `POST /api/autopilot/parse`.

## Tuning the parser against live output (2026-09-20)

The first live runs were correct but noisy: the model used `notes` to narrate every choice it made, so the page
showed a wall of text under a "could not place" warning even when every rule was fine. Four changes:

- Notes are now defined as gaps only: something the router cannot express, or a threshold too ambiguous to guess.
  One sentence each, at most two, empty when the request fits. Explanations of choices and defaults are banned;
  defaults already travel in `defaulted_fields`, which the rule cards mark on the exact value.
- `notes` and `defaulted_fields` became optional with a default, because a model told to return an empty array
  tends to drop the key instead, which failed schema validation.
- `unwrap` now fires on any doubled result, not only when the inner object still carried `notes`.
- The prompt pins two conversions that were being guessed: a percentage a user says about what a pool pays is a
  compounded APY, so `bps = round(ln(1 + percent/100) * 10000)` with worked examples, and a ledger is five seconds,
  so an hour is 720 ledgers and a day 17280.

The page shows a note as "Worth knowing" when rules did come back, and keeps the warning only when nothing could be
built. After the changes the four sample sentences return clean rules: "60% a year" is 4700 bps, "once an hour" is
720 ledgers, "wait a day" is 17280, the lira exit is `FxPrice(TRY, Below, 2000000000000)`, and the impossible ask
returns no autopilot with one sentence saying why. Tests: 14, including an OpenAI-compatible tool call.

## Deployed (2026-09-20)

https://koul-atahanyilds-projects.vercel.app, Vercel project `koul`, linked to the GitHub repo with root directory
`web` and production branch `master`, so a push redeploys. The pnpm workspace builds as is once the stale per-package
lockfiles are gone and one lockfile remains at the root. Vercel authentication on the deployment was switched off, or
the link would ask every visitor to log into Vercel.

Checked on the live URL: all five pages answer 200, the markets row reads the pool contract from the browser, and
`POST /api/autopilot/parse` returned two correct rules for "put my idle usdc to work when it is over 5, and pull
everything out if the lira passes 55" with no notes.

Not set there on purpose: `KEEPER_SECRET`, so the Funds routes answer 503 on the hosted app until someone adds it in
the dashboard. The keeper itself still runs on a laptop; it serves every wallet the router lists, including wallets
created on the hosted app.

## Everything hosted (2026-09-20)

- App at https://koul-stellar.vercel.app (`koul.vercel.app` belongs to someone else's team).
- Oracle admin at https://koul-oracle.vercel.app/oracle, its own Vercel project on `oracle-admin`, holding the mock
  oracle's admin secret server side. This is how USD/TRY is moved during a demo.
- Keeper on GitHub Actions, `.github/workflows/keeper.yml`, every five minutes plus manual dispatch, with
  `KEEPER_SECRET` and `AGENT_SECRET` as repository secrets. `keeper/src/lib/common.ts` `loadEnv` now falls back to
  the process environment, which is what made a `.env`-less runner possible. A manual run proved it end to end: the
  hosted keeper ticked both wallets and submitted `58496475f30dad58efd03acf028de01fa6f097ed14f6398cf010cdeee1bab319`
  for the browser wallet, a `withdraw` of 40 USDC that its armed rule called for.

Five minutes is the shortest schedule GitHub offers, and scheduled runs can be delayed under load. Nothing breaks at
a longer gap: the router is idempotent, a rule that is still true simply fires on the next pass. For a demo where a
rule should fire within seconds, run `pnpm keeper -- --interval 30` on a laptop as well; two keepers are safe, since
the loser of a race simulates to `None`.

## Funds on a serverless host (2026-09-20)

The hosted Deposit lira flow stopped at the first step with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir
'/var/task/web/.funds-state'`. On Vercel the working directory is read-only; the temp directory is the only writable
place, and it is not shared between instances. `FileFundsStore` now defaults to `os.tmpdir()/koul-funds` and keeps a
process-wide cache in front of the files, which is what carries a transfer through the polling that follows it on the
same instance. Records hold SEP bearer tokens and pre-authorized XDR, so they never leave the server either way.

## The hosted anchor flow works (2026-09-20)

Two problems, both from running on a serverless host, both fixed and proven on https://koul-stellar.vercel.app.

1. The transfer record was written to the working directory, which is read-only there: the flow died at the first
   step with `ENOENT: mkdir '/var/task/web/.funds-state'`. Records now go to the temp directory with a process cache
   in front.
2. The temp directory is not shared between instances, so the next request landed elsewhere and answered
   `Unknown transfer ID`. The record now travels with the caller instead, sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key derived
   from the server's own secret and returned as `state` on every answer, which the client sends back in the
   `x-koul-transfer-state` header. The browser holds an opaque blob; the SEP bearer token and the pre-authorized XDR
   inside it never leave the server in the clear.

End to end on the live site: 250.00 TRY became 5.0990227 USDC in wallet `CCDWPO4Q...`, through a landing account,
SEP-10/12/38/6, the sandbox bank leg, the pre-authorized forward and the cleanup merge.

A third, smaller fix came out of replaying an old state afterwards: reading the landing account's balance failed with
"Landing balance simulation failed" because the account had already merged itself away. A balance that cannot be read
is no longer an error; when the anchor says completed or the forward already happened, a missing landing account
means the transfer is done, which is exactly what it means on-chain.

## Why the hosted deposit looked like it failed (2026-09-20)

Opening a transfer takes ten to thirty seconds: it creates and locks a landing account, then runs SEP-10, SEP-12,
SEP-38 and SEP-6. That is longer than a serverless function's default limit, so the gateway cut the call and the UI
reported "Stopped at Preparing your transfer" while the server carried on and finished. The money arrived; the
screen said it had not.

`maxDuration = 60` on the four Funds routes gives them the time they need, and the client retries a 502 or 504 once,
which is the only class of failure worth repeating; anything the server itself refused is shown as it is.

Verified in the browser on the live site, with the passkey wallet `CC2F5O…VUIN` connected: ₺1.000,00 at 50.50 became
19.80 USDC, every step ticking in order, the FAST instructions shown with a reference, the sandbox bank leg pressed,
and the wallet chip going from 20.40 to 40.79 USDC.

## Testnet rent spike: every XOXNO call quoted 566 XLM (2026-09-22)

Saving rules on a fresh wallet failed before the first passkey: "The network quotes a fee of 566 XLM for this
transaction, above the protocol limit". The same supply had cost 0.11 XLM two days earlier. Reads on our own
contracts were unchanged; only calls into the XOXNO controller were affected, supply and withdraw alike.

Cause: the controller's 106 KB wasm lease had dropped below the contract's own renewal threshold, so every call
bundled a renewal of that wasm to the maximum lease. At testnet's current rent price that renewal alone is 550 XLM,
above the 429 XLM a transaction fee can carry, so the JS SDK refused to build the transaction. Nothing on our side
changed; the keeper's tick was blocked the same way.

Fix: renewed the leases ourselves from the keeper account, for less than the contract would have charged.

| Action | Tx |
|---|---|
| XOXNO controller code + instance, +200,000 ledgers (about 11 days), 19.82 XLM | `14fe8a2d768405b7754c8ee05516ead504179f54503d51a27e42e067524fd4dc` |
| Ed25519 verifier code + instance, +1,000,000 ledgers (about 58 days), 3.14 XLM | `59f4fca95e66176187eaaddd4412075f7146cd1672181501254aaa8d825a46a8` |

After: a supply that opens a position quotes 0.67 XLM on hub 1, an existing-position supply 0.03 XLM, a withdraw
0.03 XLM. The keeper fired on wallet `CCDWPO4Q...` within minutes (`b545113d...` supply, `0462b44b...` withdraw).

Watch: the controller renewal buys about 11 days. If XOXNO does not renew their own contract by then, the same
fee spike returns and this transaction has to be repeated. The `koul_agent_policy` and `koul_router` leases run
out in about 80,000 ledgers (4.6 days); both are small and cheap to extend.

## Router: up to 32 rules per autopilot (2026-09-22)

One autopilot per wallet, as many rules as a person wants: `MAX_RULES` in `contracts/koul_router` goes from 8 to 32.
A UI rule often becomes two contract rules (repay and withdraw are written once per hub, "move to the better hub"
once per direction), so 8 meant as few as four rules on the page. Same address, upgraded in place; the stored
autopilots and `LastFired` entries carry over. The SDK schema, the chat schema and the page mirror the new cap.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `stellar contract upload` | wasm `608bca585be781d8f5edb8aa6d1e7a51d6b975cce1f15e624e198b81d1eb1aa4`, tx `5d227beb670fc266a25790f9f70e143ae86ab67760be3580eb04007ebc28801f` |
| `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` by the keeper admin | tx `62cd9800685a36e4e28821b251af072cb3ab434029c665ca83066d196f6f686f` |
| after | `list_users()` lists the same five wallets, `list_ids(CCDWPO4Q...) = [1]` |

Build note: the homebrew `cargo` on this machine fails to load `libllhttp.9.3.dylib`; put `~/.cargo/bin` first on
`PATH` after `source scripts/env.sh` so `stellar contract build` finds the rustup toolchain.

## Test USDC without the anchor (2026-09-23)

Deposit now opens on a Testnet tab: one button, 100 USDC in the wallet in about 15 seconds. `POST
/api/faucet/test-usdc` (`web/lib/test-usdc-server.ts`) makes a throwaway G account, has friendbot fund it, buys
exactly 100 USDC (Circle testnet issuer `GBBD47IF...`) with its XLM on the testnet DEX in one transaction
(`changeTrust` + `pathPaymentStrictReceive`, send max 5,000 XLM), then calls `transfer` on the USDC contract
`CBIELTK6...` to the smart wallet. Nothing is spent from the keeper. The bank (anchor) route is still the Bank tab.
The earlier Circle-faucet route (`/api/faucet/usdc`) is untouched and unused.

| Run | Tx | Result |
|---|---|---|
| script, `sendTestUsdc(CBHMG4IG...)` | `eed3a4d5991789f7db90f2c661f8a87fec0f46643a3c91faea1ded9463f97c57` | SUCCESS, 16 s end to end |
| dev server, `POST /api/faucet/test-usdc` for `CBHMG4IG...` | `cf4132dc02ab0f41b0092e79bcc7e9eed4ac9f73bb02cc944df4322f782600ba` | SUCCESS, 14 s |
| production, `POST https://app.koul.me/api/faucet/test-usdc` for `CBHMG4IG...` | `88cbf9369c5c7bb93dd1bd99cf0dfe03f18751ab24c1eef4242a42b34adf7297` | SUCCESS, 13 s |

Depends on friendbot and on DEX liquidity for XLM/USDC; at the time a 100 USDC buy quoted 95.6 XLM on a direct path.
