# Koul backend plan and session state

Read this first in every session. Update the checklist and the "Where we are" line before ending a session. `README.md` is the run guide, `docs/` holds the logs with tx hashes. Frontend is being built by a teammate; this repo's job is the backend and a typed SDK the frontend consumes.

## Where we are

Deployed, all from this repo on `master`, every push redeploys:

- App: https://koul.me (also https://koul-stellar.vercel.app), Vercel project `koul` under the personal scope,
  root directory `web`, production branch `master`. Environment: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `KEEPER_SECRET`, `FUNDS_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=1`, `ANCHOR_HOME_DOMAINS`. Vercel authentication off so the link opens for
  anyone.
- Oracle admin: https://koul-oracle.vercel.app/oracle, Vercel project `koul-oracle`, root directory `oracle-admin`,
  with `ORACLE_ADMIN_SECRET` and `ORACLE_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=1`. This is the lever that moves USD/TRY on stage.
- Keeper: `.github/workflows/keeper.yml`, every five minutes and on demand, with `KEEPER_SECRET` and `AGENT_SECRET`
  as GitHub repository secrets. `loadEnv` falls back to the process environment, so no `.env` file is needed there.

2026-09-22 (hosts): the landing is https://koul.me and the app is https://app.koul.me (added to Vercel project `koul`,
DNS on Vercel). One project serves both: `web/proxy.ts` with the rules in `web/lib/app-host.ts` (tested). On app.koul.me
bare paths render the `web/app/app/*` routes (`/autopilot`); on koul.me any app path, including shared
`/autopilot?load=` links, 308s to app.koul.me; localhost and *.vercel.app keep the app under `/app`. Links go through
`useAppHref` (`web/lib/app-base.tsx`), whose base the app layout reads from the host. The passkey rpId is pinned to
`koul.me` on koul.me hosts, so wallets made on koul.me still open on app.koul.me. The landing has no wallet actions:
Open app and Try it first.

2026-09-22 (router cap): `MAX_RULES` raised from 8 to 32 and the router upgraded in place (wasm `608bca58...`); one
autopilot per wallet with up to 32 contract rules. The SDK schema, chat schema and the page mirror it. The Autopilot
page now shows the running rule with its live readings instead of the composer, a tap on a rule opens it in the
editor, the save bar shows the passkey steps, drafts are tab-scoped, and a paused autopilot offers Give access.
The running tile has Pause (revoke the key, rules stay), Delete (clear the rules, then revoke, with the same step strip),
Save to library and Link. The library (`web/lib/model/library.ts`) keeps named rule sets in the browser; a share link
`/autopilot?load=<token>` opens the set as a draft on any wallet. Actions take an amount (everything or a fixed USDC
number, at least 1) and the editing page shows a "What you have" panel: idle wallet, each hub with rate, debt and free
cash, loan health, USD/TRY, key days. Capital: an action can also take a share (percent of what it could move, the
router's `Amount::Percent`), a Capital pill on the editing page sets one share for every non-fixed rule, and the running
tile says which share runs. The save bar says Start autopilot / Update autopilot. MVP scope closed here on 2026-09-22.

Round 3 (2026-09-22, web only): the share pill is "Per move" and the running tile says "Each move uses up to N% of
what that rule can see" (no shared budget; a portfolio cap needs a router field, noted in docs/internal). Start /
Update / Stop autopilot wording everywhere, EDITING · N CHANGES, a stopped autopilot keeps its rules greyed. "What you
have" lights the cell the open rule reads or moves from, scrolls as a strip on phones and folds to one line with no
rule open. Amount presets 25/50/100/Max with an over-balance warning; `web/lib/rules/describe.ts` is the one wording.
Demo runner on Account behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_KOUL_DEMO=1` (testnet only) through `/api/demo/oracle`, which proxies the
oracle admin app (`KOUL_ORACLE_ADMIN_URL`); run toasts on Home. Lira line shows its rate on tap, Activity groups by day,
the access chip says RENEW under 3 days.

2026-09-22 (testnet rent): every XOXNO controller call quoted 566 XLM because the controller's wasm lease fell under
its self-renewal threshold and testnet rent is high; the JS SDK cannot build a fee that large, so Save on a fresh wallet
died at the position-opening supply and the keeper's tick was blocked. Renewed the controller lease (+200k ledgers)
and the Ed25519 verifier (+1M) from the keeper account; supply is back to under 1 XLM. Renew again in about 11 days
if XOXNO has not; `koul_agent_policy` and `koul_router` leases expire in about 4.6 days. Details in `docs/build-log.md`.

2026-09-20 (Circle faucet UI): the wallet menu has **Get test USDC** beside test XLM. A development-only route sponsors a classic G account with a Circle USDC trustline, and the menu provides its address for Circle's Stellar Testnet faucet. Status polling forwards the faucet's 20 USDC through the existing pre-authorized landing-account bridge to the smart wallet. The browser retains the transfer ID so polling can resume. The Circle CAPTCHA and request remain on Circle's site. This flow builds and typechecks, but a live faucet request has not been completed yet.

2026-09-20 (frontend, latest): the teammate's UI (`web/`, commit "ui impel v0") is merged and wired to the v2 stack. Sample data and the demo switch are gone (`lib/data/mock.ts`, `use-demo-mode.ts`, `DemoChip`); every hook reads testnet through `@koul/core` (`lib/data/live.ts`): pools, USD/TRY, portfolio + position NFT (the NFT gives the XOXNO account id), chain autopilots, `Fired` events. `lib/model/autopilot.ts` maps UI rules to the router's `Autopilot` (`toCoreAutopilot` / `fromCoreAutopilot`); `use-autopilots.ts` arms through `buildGrantAgent` + `buildSetAutopilot` and can `clear`. The Funds runner drives the real funds routes (new `POST /api/funds/:id/simulate` for the sandbox bank leg; `FundsService.simulateBankTransfer`). `@koul/core` is a `link:` dependency in web and keeper; core imports lost their `.js` suffixes for Turbopack. `next build` passes; home, portfolio, autopilots and funds render live in Chrome with an empty wallet. Still stubs: `app/autopilots/new` (sentence box + builder) and `app/autopilots/[id]` (rule cards, arm sheet); their components exist under `components/autopilot/`. Next: build those two pages on `useAutopilotEditor` / `useArmAutopilot` and the `/api/autopilot/parse` route, then a live end-to-end run with a browser passkey wallet.

2026-09-20 (current): sections A, B, C are done and proven live (see `docs/build-log.md`, "Router v2", "Policy v2", "Keeper v2"). D1-D8 are implemented in `packages/core`; the SDK live smoke verified portfolio, oracle, check, tick simulation, events, codec and unsigned builders. E1-E4 are implemented with mocked model tests. F1-F4 are implemented as local demo backend functions and reference routes, but a live deposit smoke stopped at anchor `pending_anchor`; the user asked to ignore the broken anchor for now (details in `docs/build-log.md`). G is complete: mock oracle admin runs separately on port 3100 and the web app reads the oracle directly. H1 confirmed the testnet position NFT. The new frontend UI still needs integration verification against the v2 SDK; no further anchor work is planned this session.

Earlier: the router is a rule engine on its fixed address; the policy is redeployed at `CBDQPSGJ...5AR2` with a pinned account id and a withdraw-recipient check; the keeper is stateless and the three scenarios fired through the new stack. Deviations from the sketch below, all deliberate: `tick` returns `Option<Executed {rule_index, kind, amount, from_hub, to_hub}>`; `check` returns `Vec<RuleState {ready, holds, conditions: Vec<ConditionState {holds, observed}>, last_fired}>`; `RepayWithCollateral(withdraw_hub, repay_hub, amount)` names both hubs; `KoulAgentParams` has `account_id`.

Earlier the same day: backend v1 complete (fixed three-branch router, keeper, policy, mock oracle, anchor both ways). Decisions taken with the user: router becomes a rule engine; cash out to TRY is a "withdraw to wallet, then user confirms cash out on the Funds page" flow (option A); AI sentence-to-rules uses a strict schema and a server route; the position NFT card is checked and dropped if none exists; the frontend is not our work.

## Decisions (do not reopen)

- Custody stays in the user's smart account; agent key + `koul_agent_policy` (Plan B). No vault.
- Rules are evaluated on-chain by the router. The keeper only submits `tick`.
- An autopilot is an ordered list of rules. On each tick the router checks rules top to bottom and runs the first one that is true, then stops. At most one action per tick.
- A rule has 1 to 3 conditions joined by all or any, one action, one cooldown. No if, no else.
- Cash out to TRY is never an agent action. A rule can withdraw to the wallet; the user confirms the TRY withdrawal with one passkey.
- Mock oracle on testnet, Reflector interface; `set_oracle` swaps it on mainnet.
- Product copy is English only.

## Rule engine: what we have and what we need

Have (`contracts/koul_router`): one `Rules` struct per user with fixed fields (`hub_a`, `hub_b`, `rebalance_threshold_bps`, `min_health_factor_wad`, `fx_enabled`, `fx_asset`, `fx_level`, `fx_above`, `max_price_age_secs`); `tick(user)` with a fixed priority health > rebalance > fx exit; amount helpers (`floor_grain`, `ceil_grain`, `withdrawable`, `MIN_MOVE`); `Fired` event; `upgrade`, `set_oracle`; 3 unit tests. Keeper ticks one hard-coded user. Policy allowlists `router.tick`, `controller.withdraw / supply / repay`, `usdc.transfer` to pool.

Need:

```
enum Cmp { Below, AtOrAbove }                       // two comparators are enough for every condition
enum Amount { All, Percent(u32 bps), Fixed(i128) }  // 7-decimal USDC for Fixed
enum Condition {
  HealthFactor { cmp, level_wad: i128 },
  SupplyRateGap { hub_over: u32, hub_under: u32, min_bps: u32 },   // rate(hub_over) - rate(hub_under) >= min_bps
  FxPrice { asset: Symbol, cmp, level: i128, max_age_secs: u64 },   // oracle lastprice, 14 decimals, USD per unit
  IdleBalance { cmp, amount: i128 },                                // USDC balance of the wallet
}
enum Action {
  MoveSupply { from_hub, to_hub, amount: Amount },
  RepayFromWallet { hub, amount: Amount },
  RepayWithCollateral { hub, amount: Amount },      // withdraw from hub then repay hub
  WithdrawToWallet { hub, amount: Amount },
}
struct Rule { conditions: Vec<Condition>, match_all: bool, action: Action, cooldown_ledgers: u32 }
struct Autopilot { account_id: u64, rules: Vec<Rule> }
storage: Autopilot(user, id) -> Autopilot; LastFired(user, id, rule_index) -> ledger; Ids(user) -> Vec<u32>; Users -> Vec<Address>
fns: set_autopilot(user, id, ap) [user auth], clear_autopilot(user, id) [user auth], get_autopilot, list_ids(user), list_users(),
     tick(user, id) -> Option<(u32 rule_index, Action)> [user auth, agent signs],
     check(user, id) -> Vec<Vec<bool>> [no auth, read-only: per rule, per condition truth] for live UI
event: Fired { user, autopilot_id, rule_index, action kind, amount, from_hub, to_hub, observed }
```

Constraints carried over: amounts snapped to 0.01 USDC, min move 1 USDC, repay rounded up one grain, withdrawals capped by hub cash and max utilisation, price staleness per condition, cooldown checked before evaluating conditions, `match_all` false means any.

## Checklist

### A. Router rule engine (`contracts/koul_router`)
- [x] A1 types above as `contracttype`s, storage keys, migrate constructor signature if needed
- [x] A2 `set_autopilot` / `clear_autopilot` / `get_autopilot` / `list_ids` / `list_users`, validation (1..=3 conditions, hubs differ for MoveSupply, cooldown > 0, max_age > 0, at most 32 rules since 2026-09-22, 8 before)
- [x] A3 condition evaluation with the existing reads; `check` view
- [x] A4 `tick`: cooldown, first true rule, execute action with the existing amount logic, record LastFired, emit Fired
- [x] A5 unit tests for evaluation, ordering, cooldown, amount resolution
- [x] A6 build, upload, `upgrade` on `CBHRTWXA...`, log wasm hash in `docs/build-log.md`

### B. Policy hardening (`contracts/koul_agent_policy`)
- [x] B1 `withdraw` recipient check: controller `withdraw(user, id, entries, Some(to))` must have `to == smart_account` (today any `to` passes); same for any call that names a destination
- [x] B2 redeploy policy, new address in README, `keeper/.env`, `web/lib/koul.ts`; re-grant on the headless wallet

### C. Keeper (`keeper/`)
- [x] C1 iterate `list_users` x `list_ids`, tick each, per-autopilot log line
- [x] C2 `setup-rules.ts` becomes `setup-autopilot.ts` writing the "Lira shield" autopilot (five rules: health guard, rate gap both ways, FX exit per hub); `position.ts` and `policy-deny.ts` added
- [x] C3 rerun the three live scenarios (rebalance, fx exit, health guard) and record hashes in `docs/build-log.md`

### D. Typed SDK for the frontend (`packages/core`, published as a workspace package `@koul/core`)
- [x] D1 TypeScript types mirroring the contract types, plus `zod` schemas (the strict data type the LLM must produce)
- [x] D2 `encodeAutopilot(ap) -> ScVal`, `decodeAutopilot(ScVal) -> Autopilot`, round-trip tests
- [x] D3 `validateAutopilot(ap)` with the same limits the contract enforces, returning readable errors
- [x] D4 reads: `readPortfolio(address, accountId?)` (idle USDC, XLM, positions per hub, health factor, hub rates, cash, utilisation), `readOracle()`, `simulateTick(user, id)` (no signing, returns the action or none), `checkAutopilot(user, id)` (per condition truth), `readFired(user, startLedger)` events
- [x] D5 writes as unsigned `AssembledTransaction`s the frontend hands to `kit.signAndSubmit`: `buildSetAutopilot`, `buildClearAutopilot`, `buildGrantAgent`, `buildRevokeAgent`, `buildSupply`, `buildWithdraw`, `buildBorrow`, `buildTransfer`
- [x] D6 `permissionsFor(ap, contracts)` -> the minimal allowlist and the plain-English list for the arm sheet
- [x] D7 templates: Lira shield, Yield only, Health guard as `Autopilot` factories taking an account ID
- [x] D8 README section "Frontend integration" documenting D1 to D7 with examples

### E. Sentence to rules (`packages/core` + a server route the frontend app hosts)
- [x] E1 prompt + tool definition: Claude receives the vocabulary and returns an `Autopilot` matching the zod schema via structured output; unknown or unsupported asks come back in a `notes[]` field, never invented
- [x] E2 `parseAutopilot(text, context)` function taking live readings so defaults are sensible; validate with D3 before returning; mark defaulted fields
- [x] E3 reference Next route handler `POST /api/autopilot/parse` in `web/app/api` that the teammate can copy, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` server-side only
- [x] E4 tests with 6 sentences including one impossible ask (mocked model output; live call pending)

### F. Funds backend (anchor)
- [x] F1 deposit and withdrawal as server functions in `packages/core/funds` (landing/SEP helpers moved from keeper): create landing account, SEP-10/12/38/6, return a `transferId` and a status the UI polls, step by step
- [x] F2 withdrawal step that needs the passkey returns a serialized unsigned transfer tx for the frontend, then continues when the landing balance arrives
- [x] F3 reference route handlers `POST /api/funds/deposit`, `POST /api/funds/withdraw`, `GET /api/funds/:id`
- [x] F4 "ready to cash out" detection: wallet idle USDC above a threshold after a `WithdrawToWallet` fired

### G. Oracle admin app (`oracle-admin/`)
- [x] G1 move `web/app/oracle` and `web/app/api/oracle` into a separate Next app on port 3100, remove from `web/`

### H. Housekeeping
- [x] H1 position NFT: check whether the testnet controller exposes a position NFT; note the answer in README
- [x] H2 ship `web/.env.example` (gitignore pattern) or document only
- [x] H3 keep README and this file current; update `docs/build-log.md` with every on-chain change

## Session protocol

1. Read `PLAN.md`, then `README.md` sections "Live testnet deployment" and "Running the stack locally".
2. `source scripts/env.sh`. Contracts build only with `stellar contract build`.
3. Work the checklist top to bottom unless the user reorders. Tick items here as they land.
4. Every on-chain change goes to `docs/build-log.md` with the tx hash. Every new address goes to README, `keeper/.env.example`, `web/lib/koul.ts`.
5. Commit locally with plain messages, no trailers. Push only when asked.
6. Before ending: update "Where we are" above.
